## Overview

College Cuisine Connect is a project designed to help college students with limited cooking skills and resources discover nutritious and budget-friendly recipes. The platform fosters a sense of community by facilitating the sharing of culinary experiences among students. It provides a centralized hub offering a diverse range of recipes tailored to the specific constraints of college life, including limited kitchen access and time constraints.

The user-friendly interface allows students to explore quick and easy recipes, from microwave-based meals to those requiring minimal cooking equipment. The platform considers dietary preferences, allergies, and restrictions to ensure inclusivity within the UH community. College Cuisine Connect aims to provide a curated collection of college lifestyle recipes, encourage healthy eating habits, and establish a supportive community for recipe sharing.

My primary focus revolved around enhancing the functionality of the My Cookbook page, a dedicated space for students to manage their created recipes.

In particular, I took charge of developing the Add Recipe and Edit Recipe pages, empowering users to seamlessly add, edit, and delete their culinary creations. Additionally, I refined the user interface for a more cohesive experience throughout the website. Moreover, I incorporated authentic recipes into the website, ensuring a practical platform for culinary exploration.

## Lessons Learned

Engaging in this collaborative endeavor provided me with valuable insights into collaborative coding practices. Working within a group setting, I honed my collaborative coding skills by adhering to the principles of Issue Driven Project Management. This involved creating issues and branches on GitHub, facilitating a streamlined workflow where team members could work on designated parts without encountering conflicts.

Moreover, I deepened my understanding of the Meteor framework, delving into the intricacies of managing collectionsâ€”mastering the art of adding and editing collections. In the Meteor framework, the process involves crafting components that are seamlessly integrated into pages. Leveraging the power of React and Bootstrap, I discovered how these tools simplify the styling of pages, allowing for a more efficient and visually appealing development process.
