During my high school years, I learned Processing (p5.js) as part of my coursework. In one of our assignments, we developed a rudimentary side-scrolling game, an experience that inspired me to create my own game using the p5.js library. My motivation for starting this project was to provide my younger sibling a fun experience that also serves to enhance her typing skills.

This project includes a title screen that allows players to adjust difficulty levels and enable or disable power-up options. It also features background music, sound effects, and custom artwork.

The gameplay involves contending with a horde of potatoes that advance towards the player's character. To thwart the impending potato onslaught, players must swiftly type the corresponding key on their keyboard to disintegrate the potatoes. Failing to input the correct key or allowing a potato to reach the character results in the loss of a life. If all lives are depleted, the player loses the game.
